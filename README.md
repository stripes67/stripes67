- 👋 Hi, I’m @stripes67
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about api implentation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to impliment pdf api's for my work website.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:  well, not sure since I am a nubee on coding.  I've played with coding before, but mostly in specific applications rather than in long-term usage.
- 📫 You can reach me via email: royalones@hotmail.com
